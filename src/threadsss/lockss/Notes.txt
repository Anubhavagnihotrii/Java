Ex. There as 1 Notebook and 3 children are trying simultaneously to write something.
    Definitely there's a chance information won't be proper, so to handle these kind of scenarios
    we use locks.


Locks Types:
    Intrinsic -> these are built into every object in java.
                 You don't see them but they're there.
                 When you are using synchronized keyword, you're using these automatic locks
    Explicit ->
                These are more advanced locks you can control yourself
                using Locks class from java.util.concurrent.locks.
                Here we explicitly say when to lock and unlock, giving more control
                over how and when people can write in the notebook.
