Thread is the smallest unit of execution within a program.

Threads can be created:
- By extending Thread
- By implementing Runnable
- By implementing Callable (returns a value and can throw exceptions)
- Using Executors / Thread Pools (more efficient)

- The only difference between Runnable and Callable is Callable returns a value while Runnable doesn't.
and callable have call() while runnable have run().

Thread Lifecycle:
- New – Thread object is created, not started.
- Runnable – Thread is ready, waiting for CPU.
- Running – Thread is executing its run() method.
- Blocked / Waiting – Waiting for a lock or notification.
- Terminated – Thread has finished execution.

Race Condition:
- Occurs when multiple threads access shared resources simultaneously.
- Example: count++ is not atomic.
- Without synchronization, updates can be lost → wrong results.

Synchronization:
- synchronized keyword ensures only one thread can access a block/method at a time.
- Locks are per object (instance method) or per class (static method).
- Helps prevent race conditions.
- Downside: can reduce performance if overused.
