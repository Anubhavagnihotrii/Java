Strategy Design Pattern

Enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime.
It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

Here we are encapsulating the algorithm for sending notifications (email, sms, push notification) in separate classes
that implement a common interface inside a NotificationStrategyContext class by sendNotification method.

Strategy Pattern is useful when:
- You have multiple algorithms for a specific task and want to switch between them dynamically.
- You want to avoid conditional statements for selecting algorithms.
- You want to encapsulate algorithms to make them easier to maintain and extend.

Strategy Pattern promotes the Open/Closed Principle by allowing new strategies to be added without modifying existing code.

Strategy Pattern can be combined with other patterns like Factory Pattern to create strategy instances.

Strategy vs Factory Pattern:
- Strategy Pattern focuses on selecting an algorithm at runtime.
- Factory Pattern focuses on creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
